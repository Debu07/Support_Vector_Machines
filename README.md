SVM - SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES


SVM ARE SUPERVISED LEARNING MODELS WITH ASSOCIATED LEARNING ALGORITHMS THAT ANALYZE DATA AND RECOGNIZE PATTERNS USED FOR CLASSIFICATION AND REGRESSION ANALYSIS

AN SVM MODEL IS A REPRESENTATION OF THE EXAMPLES AS POINTS IN SPACE MAPPED SO THAT THE EXAMPLES OF THE SEPARATE CATEGORIES AND DIVIDED BY THE CLEAR GAP THAT IS AS WIDE AS POSSIBLE

NEW EXAMPLES ARE THEN MAPPED INTO THE SAME SPACE AND PREDICTED TO BELONG TO A CATEGORY BASED ON WHICH SIDE OF THE GAP THEY FALL ON 

I AM HERE USING  SVM TO PREDICT WHETHER A TUMOR IS MALIGNANT OR BENIGN USING INBUILT DATASETS PROVIDED BY SKLEARN
